# LLM-Study
The study of Large Language Models (LLMs) focuses on understanding and developing advanced AI systems that use deep learning techniques to process and generate human-like text. These models, such as GPT, BERT, and others, are trained on vast datasets to learn linguistic patterns, context, and reasoning.
